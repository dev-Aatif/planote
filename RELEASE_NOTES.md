# Planote 1.0.0 Release Notes

We are excited to announce the release of **Planote 1.0.0**! This release marks a significant milestone in our journey to provide a beautiful, focused, and secure note-taking application.

## 🌟 Highlights

### Simplified Note Experience
We've taken a bold step to declutter your writing environment. The Note Editor has been streamlined to focus purely on your content and structure.
-   **Distraction-Free**: We removed complex formatting (Bold, Italic, etc.) to help you focus on what matters—your words.
-   **Structural Clarity**: Retained full support for **Headings (H1-H6)** to keep your notes organized and readable.

### 🛡️ Robust & Secure
Under the hood, Planote is stronger than ever.
-   **Data Integrity**: We've hardened the database with strict Foreign Key constraints and fixed critical bugs that could lead to data inconsistencies.
-   **Reliable Undo/Redo**: A completely rewritten Undo/Redo system ensures your actions are tracked and reversed perfectly every time.
-   **Security First**: Enhanced input validation and protection against potential vulnerabilities.
